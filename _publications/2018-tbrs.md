abstract: "We provide a new computational model of working memory in the complex span task implemented in the ARCADIA cognitive framework. While there exist implementations of working memory successful enough to account for many of the benchmark findings in the working memory literature, we demonstrate that further progress requires the integration of these models with a rich conception of attention. ARCADIA provides this intersection, allowing for precise control of the focus of attention on a time scale fine enough to begin to disentangle the overlapping effects of interference, temporal decay, and attentional refreshing."
