Over the past year, I have served as a guest lecturer for the
[Cognitive Neuroscience Research
Internship](https://sites.duke.edu/cogneuroresearchinternship/), which
is a semester-long research internship aimed at getting undergraduate
students from underrepresented minorities involved in cognitive
neuroscience research, teaching them Python, and setting them up with
connections for future research after the program is over.

In the fall of 2022, I guest lectured on moral judgment, introducing the
students to [one of my favorite papers by Phillips & Cushman
(2017)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1619717114). In
this paper, the authors find evidence that when under pressure, people
have a tendency to erroneously identify _immoral_ events as
_impossible_, which has implications for counterfactual thinking more
broadly. Additionally, we talked about the role of moral judgment in
society, some theories about morality and moral judgment, as well as
some fun and interesting cases like the Trolley Problem.

In the spring of 2023, I guest lectured again, but this time on the
role of computational modeling and theory-building in psychology and
neuroscience, using [this excellent paper by Guest & Martin
(2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691620970585?casa_token=l1nxUuCfbiEAAAAA:8xQCjkMJHKXhPwPScXpXPppZT9GzT0ybex-bIIfhcpI8OnYBPltWWE4pymCH00Y72HqTI15L-dI)
as a starting point. After talking abstractly about how modeling helps
force theory-building, we got our hands dirty by specifying,
implementing, and revising signal detection models in Python (code
worksheet
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Znwv4wi3_4jJXo4-PQK1EesIM9z0ssCM?usp=sharing)). Although
many students were completely new to the idea of computational
modeling, working through the example themselves was a great way to
highlight how modeling and hypothesis-testing is done in everyday
scientific practice!
