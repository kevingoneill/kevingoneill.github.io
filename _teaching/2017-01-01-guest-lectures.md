While I was an undergrad at RPI, I had the opportunity to guest
lecture for a couple sessions of the courses *Introduction to Logic*
and *Are Humans Rational?* taught by my advisor, Selmer Bringsjord. In
these lectures, I introduced the concept of [natural
deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction),
demonstrated its effectiveness for constructing proofs in my
implementation of John Pollock's theorem prover
[OSCAR](https://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu/projects/automated-reasoners/oscar/),
and then I showed how OSCAR could be used to solve a classic paradox
in philosophy, the [Lottery Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_paradox).
