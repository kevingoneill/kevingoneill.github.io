In the summer of 2020 I was a teaching assistant for Pod 089 Solid
Firefly in the first session of [Neuromatch
Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/){:target="_blank"}! Over
three weeks I guided my 9 students through a whirlwind tour of
everything computational neuroscience, from basic modeling concepts
(e.g., "What is a model?"), regression models, and python programming,
to more advanced models like Hidden Markov Models, RL models, and deep
neural networks. Finally, I helped my 9 students split into two groups
to create their own long-term group projects.

Here's a photo of my pod!
