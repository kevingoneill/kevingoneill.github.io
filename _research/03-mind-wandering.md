In collaborations with Dr. Paul Seli and Dr. Kristina Krasich, I have
also studied our unending habit of mind-wandering. While cognitive
scientists would like to pretend that people are faithfully attending
to their assigned tasks at all times, the reality is that much of our
time is spent doing some sort of mind-wandering. So, it's important to
understand what our minds are doing when they wander.

In one study, we investigated a seemingly paradoxical result in the
psychological literature. Traditionally, researchers have thought of
mind-wandering as a type of failure in executive control: we
mind-wander when we fail to focus on the task at hand. However, even
though older adults have been shown to have less executive control
than younger adults, research has shown that older adults actually
mind-wander *less* than their younger counterparts! We proposed that
this result could be explained if older adults were simply more
motivated than younger adults to do the tasks that we assigned
them. And this is exactly what we found: whereas older adults were
highly motivated to perform simple and boring tasks, younger adults
were less motivated. Not only did this difference in motivation
explain the difference in mind-wandering, but we also showed that the
difference in mind-wandering could be eliminated if we paid the
younger adults an additional bonus for performing well at our task
(Seli et al., 2021).

In another study, we investigated different properties of
mind-wandering. It is common to measure an instance of mind-wandering
as a thought that is unrelated (whether intentionally or
unintentionally) to the task at hand. But, psychologists have also
proposed that mind-wandering could be defined as a lack of attentional
constraints which allows thoughts to flow freely from one to
another. Do these definitions agree on what mind-wandering is, or do
they index different dimensions of mind-wandering? When comparing
self-reports, we found that these dimensions were indeed separable,
suggesting that studies focusing on one definition might show
different results under a different definition (O'Neill et al., 2021).

Finally, in collaboration with [Dr. Kristina
Krasich](https://sites.duke.edu/kkrasich/), I've studied how people
move their eyes when their minds wander. Normally, vision scientists
find that when people fixate on a stimulus for a longer period of
time, it is because they are attending to it so that they can process
it more deeply. But recent studies have shown that when people
mind-wander, they also tend to fixate for longer periods of time. So
do longer fixations indicate that people are paying more or less
attention?  Using a computational model of scene viewing, we showed
that when people attend to a stimulus, the evidence accumulation
process controlling eye movements operates more slowly to gather
important information. In contrast, when people mind-wander, this
process is simply more variable, and it is this variability that
causes people to fixate longer on average. This finding agrees with
other work showing that people are more variable when they
mind-wander.
