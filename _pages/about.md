I'm a recent PhD graduate at Duke University working with [Dr. Felipe
De Brigard](https://www.imclab.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. John
Pearson](https://pearsonlab.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. I use a mix
of methods from psychology, computational modeling, and cognitive
neuroscience to understand the computations underlying causal
judgment, among other interests. Starting in the fall, I'm heading to
London to work with [Dr. Steve Fleming](http://metacoglab.org) and
[Dr. David Lagnado](https://causalcognitionlab.com) at UCL to study
connections between counterfactual thinking and metacognition.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Paul
Bello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=72lZt54AAAAJ){:target="_blank"}
and [Dr. Will Bridewell](https://paravidya.com/){:target="_blank"} to
model a range of cognitive phenomena in their cognitive framework
ARCADIA. Before that, I did my undergraduate research with [Dr. Selmer
Bringsjord](https://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu/){:target="_blank"} using
formal logic to enable flexible reasoning in AI.
