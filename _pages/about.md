I'm a postdoctoral research associate at University College London
with [Dr. Steve Fleming](http://metacoglab.org) studying connections
between counterfactual thinking and metacognition. In my work, I use a
mix of methods from psychology, computational modeling, and cognitive
neuroscience to understand the computations underlying causal
judgment, among other interests.

In 2024, I completed my PhD at Duke University working with
[Dr. Felipe De Brigard](https://www.imclab.org/){:target="_blank"} and
[Dr. John Pearson](https://pearsonlab.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
Before that, I worked with [Dr. Paul
Bello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=72lZt54AAAAJ){:target="_blank"}
and [Dr. Will Bridewell](https://paravidya.com/){:target="_blank"} to
model a range of cognitive phenomena in their cognitive framework
ARCADIA.
